# Info465 Project

## What the Code Does
This project is written in JavaScript and it asks the user to enter a number. When the user enters a number the code calculates the mean and median and prints it out to the user. If the user enters an invalid number, it will alert the user and continue. If the user is done entering numbers, all they have to do is enter "q" into the code to quit it. 

# Info465 Project 2

## What the Code Does
This project is written in JavaScript and when the program is ran, it prompts the user to continously enter integers. The program stores the integers that the user enters into an array to see if any two integers equals a third one that is in the list and it also echoes the inputs that the user enters back to them. If the user enters a valid input, it will inform them by saying "Condition is met.", If the user enters an invalid integer, it will inform them by saying "Condition was not met." and when the uesr is finished using the program, they can either enter "q" or "Q" to quit.
