# Info465 Project

## What the Code Does
This project is written in JavaScript and it asks the user to enter a number. When the user enters a number the code calculates the mean and median and prints it out to the user. If the user enters an invalid number, it will alert the user and continue. If the user is done entering numbers, all they have to do is enter "q" into the code to quit it.
